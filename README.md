# Text Encryption & Decryption Toolkit

A Python-based command-line tool that provides multiple classical encryption and decryption methods for text processing. This toolkit implements five different cipher algorithms with an interactive menu system.

## 🔐 Features

The toolkit supports the following encryption methods:

**1. Atbash Cipher**
- Reverses the alphabet (A↔Z, B↔Y, etc.)
- Preserves case and non-alphabetic characters
- Symmetric operation (encryption = decryption)

**2. Alphanumeric Cipher**
- Converts alphabetic characters to their position numbers (A=1, B=2, etc.)
- Uses hyphens as separators between numbers
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters in original positions

**3. Caesar Cipher**
- Shifts each letter by 3 positions in the alphabet
- Classic implementation with wrap-around
- Preserves case and non-alphabetic characters

**4. ROT-n Cipher**
- Customizable rotation cipher (user-defined shift value)
- Similar to Caesar but with variable shift amount
- Maintains original text structure with non-alphabetic characters

**5. Vigenère Cipher**
- Polyalphabetic substitution using a keyword
- Key repeats to match text length
- Validates key to contain only alphabetic characters
- Advanced security through keyword-based encryption

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prakhar88/text-encryption-toolkit.git
cd text-encryption-toolkit
```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

3. Run the main program:
```bash
python Encryption.py
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the Program

Execute the main script to start the interactive menu:

```bash
python Encryption.py
```

### Menu Options

- **1. Encrypt** - Choose from 5 encryption methods
- **2. Decrypt** - Decrypt using the corresponding method  
- **3. Exit** - Close the program

### Example Usage

```
Welcome to text encrypter and decrypter
1.Encrypt
2.Decrypt
3.exit
enter choice: 1

enter the message below:
Hello World!

Enter the type of encryption you want?
1. Atbash (Flips around the alphabets)
2. Alphanumeric (turns alphabets into number)
3. Caesar(not the salad) (shifts the alphabet ahead by 3)
4. Rotation_n (Rotates the message by n characters)
5. Vigenere (encrypt using a key)
enter choice: 1

Svool Dliow!
```

## 🔍 Cipher Details

### Atbash Cipher
- **Algorithm:** Maps each letter to its mirror position in the alphabet
- **Example:** "Hello" → "Svool"
- **Note:** Encryption and decryption use the same function

### Alphanumeric Cipher
- **Algorithm:** Converts letters to numbers (A/a=1, B/b=2, etc.)
- **Example:** "Hello" → "8-5-12-12-15"
- **Format:** Numbers separated by hyphens

### Caesar Cipher
- **Algorithm:** Shifts each letter 3 positions forward (encryption) or backward (decryption)
- **Example:** "Hello" → "Khoor"
- **Wrap-around:** Z shifts to C, A shifts back to X

### ROT-n Cipher
- **Algorithm:** User-defined rotation amount
- **Example:** "Hello" with n=5 → "Mjqqt"
- **Interactive:** Prompts for rotation value

### Vigenère Cipher
- **Algorithm:** Uses a repeating keyword to shift letters variably
- **Example:** "Hello" with key "KEY" → "Rijvs"
- **Security:** More secure than simple substitution ciphers
- **Validation:** Ensures key contains only alphabetic characters

## ⚠️ Error Handling

The program includes robust error handling for:
- Invalid menu choices
- Non-numeric input where numbers are expected
- Invalid keys for Vigenère cipher
- Key length validation for Vigenère cipher

## 📝 Technical Notes

- All ciphers preserve the case of original text
- Non-alphabetic characters (spaces, punctuation, numbers) remain unchanged
- The program uses ASCII values for character manipulation
- Modular arithmetic ensures proper wrap-around for alphabet boundaries

## 🎓 Educational Purpose

This toolkit is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate classical cryptography techniques. These ciphers are **not suitable** for securing sensitive information in real-world applications.
